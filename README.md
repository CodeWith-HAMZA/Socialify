# Whole Social Media Platform, it will be more expanded, work continues, some SS's are here.

# Kindly Note:-
## One Of The Major Factor To Build Any "Huge-Large-Scale-Product" and Small "Product" is their "Code-Base". Your Code Base defines, that if it can handle large-user-base?
#### So, The Key is All About Not Always "What" But Also The "How", How well Feature is organized in code-base matters Alot! when carrying vision for Large-Scale-Application.


##### here are key features for time-saving, posts crud and follow unfollow like features are common.
## Key Featurtes:-
* While Creating a Post, Twitter Like Text Input Like Animation for Characters Limit
* Popular Reels feature, as it has come to almost all the social-media platform whether it's fb, insta, or tik tok etc
* nested reply system, like each "Thread" has its own replies threads and those replies can also have threads.
  "Tree-Like-Structure" with DB and Client-Side React.
* Infinite Loading with Skeleton Using Intersection-Observer-API in JS.
* Social-Authentication, Continue with google github with GMAIL-OTP using Modern-Way Of Doing With "(Clerk) Service".

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
